      <h2 id="Pagetitle">ARSI National Field Day and Hill Topping Contest 2024</h2>
      
      <div id="content">
        <p>The Crown Club participated in the ARSI National Field Day and Hill Topping Contest 2024, which was held on January 27-28, 2024, under the supervision of Dr. Umesh Shinde. The event's goal was to assess amateur radio communication skills in outdoor settings, therefore teams were required to set up their own radio stations on hilltops.</p>
        
        <p>The team consisted of 11 people (8 undergraduate students and 3 seasoned alumni), who chose a hilltop in Satara for their operations. They entered Category A (20m and 40m HF bands) and constructed stacked half-wave dipole antennas using bamboo and insulated copper wires, calibrated for optimal performance with a VNA equipment. These antennas were connected to an ICOM 718 transceiver using RG58 A/U coaxial wires.</p>
        
        <br />
        
        <p><i>Notable moments from the event include:</i></p>
        
        <p>The first crew arrived at the hilltop on January 26, 2024, to choose the optimal location for the antennae.</p>
        
        <p>A later group joined, bringing further supplies for the antenna construction. After attempts to power the transceiver with a car battery were insufficient, a generator was required.</p>
        
        <p>The crew had successful HF contacts (40m, 20m) with a variety of amateur radio operators, including VU2CHD.</p>
        
        <p>A VHF half-wave dipole antenna was also tested using Baofeng radios rated at 10 watts.</p>

        <p><b>Key takeaways were:</b></p>
        
        <ul style={{ marginLeft: '20px' }}>
          <li><p>The need for careful planning and preparation for antenna installations.</p></li>
          <li><p>Practical problem-solving abilities are fostered through on-site improvisation.</p></li>
          <li><p>Improving essential RF understanding and taking into account regional conditions when sitting antennas.</p></li>
          <li><p>The experience provided invaluable learning opportunities, strengthening core amateur radio skills and motivating participants to improve their technical abilities for upcoming contests.</p></li>
