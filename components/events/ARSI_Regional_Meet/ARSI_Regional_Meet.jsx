          <p> <br />     Following the successful ARSI regional meeting held in Chennai in early February 2023, a similar gathering was proposed for Mumbai, coordinated by the regional team which includes Jatin (VU2KWJ) and Huzefa (VU2HIT). <br />  The aim of these regional meetings is to promote awareness of ARSI's position as the sole member society from India in IARU-Region 3 and to illustrate how contributions from individual members can enhance ARSI's interactions with regulatory bodies like WPC and improve its status in the global amateur radio community.
